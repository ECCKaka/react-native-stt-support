## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Does Voce upload my audio to the cloud?
A: By default, the free tier runs 100% on-device — audio and transcripts stay on your device unless you explicitly enable Pro cloud features.

Q: The app isn't transcribing — what should I check?
A:
1. Microphone permission: Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Voce (enabled).
2. Sufficient disk space and battery.
3. For best on-device performance, use a modern device and try shorter audio segments.

Q: Can I export subtitles or text?
A: Yes — export as .txt or .srt via the Share/Export action in the transcript viewer.

## Troubleshooting
- Re-run transcription after restarting the app.
- If the app crashes, please collect a crash log and include device model, OS version, app version, and sample audio if possible.
- For Pro/cloud issues, check your network connection and subscription status in the app.
